Feature	Description

Battery level	Remaining battery %
Connectivity degree	# of connected neighbor nodes
Aggregation potential	# of packets waiting for same time window
Current latency estimate	Measured network delay
Encryption power	Node’s hardware encryption speed
Load factor	Buffer occupancy
Trust score	Historical reliability (can be simple moving average or feedback based)
Packet age	Time since packet was created

(B) Action Space
* Choose which neighbor node to forward packet to.
* Or send directly to cloud (if no better neighbor).

(C) Reward Function
We design a reward function that combines:
R=w1⋅AggregationSuccess−w2⋅Latency−w3⋅EnergyUsd+w4⋅TrustScore-w5⋅PacketLossPenalty

Where:
AggregationSuccess: Reward if aggregation occurred.
Latency: Negative reward if delay increases.
EnergyUsed: Penalizes higher energy consumption.
TrustScore: Encourages routing through reliable nodes.
PacketLossPenalty: Large negative reward if packet is dropped.

RL Policy:
→ Forward to best next hop (or cloud)
→ Optimize: aggregation count ↑, latency ↓, energy ↓, trust ↑

Trust can be dynamically updated by:
Packet delivery success rates
Aggregation success - how well they aggregate /speed and amount
Node responsiveness - node reliability
Error rates (drops, duplicates, errors)
For example:
TrustScore=0.8⋅PreviousTrust+0.2⋅CurrentPerformance
